Гороскоп на 03-11-2024:
New ideas percolate under the Pisces new moon, dear Capricorn, bringing freshness to how you view your world and the people who fill it. This cosmic climate encourages curiosity, marking the ideal time to set educational goals for the next six months. You'll have a chance to clear the mind and simply be when Neptune stirs this afternoon, though lofty thoughts and discussions may follow. Indulge the senses with nostalgic sights, flavors, and sounds when Mercury blows a kiss to Pluto, asking you to remember where you came from. Invest in your home as evening rolls in and the moon enters Aries.
